# Part 4 – Testing & Debugging

This folder contains unit tests, integration tests, and debugging plans.

## Structure
- **kotlin/** → Unit tests using JUnit.

## Debugging Plan
- **App crashes** → logs, crashlytics, and breakpoints.
- **API timeouts** → Add retry policies, exponential backoff, and fallback messages.
- **Incorrect rendering** → Test on multiple devices & use responsive UI design.
